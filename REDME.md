# Adding the App Bar

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The app bar, also known as the action bar, is one of the most important design elements in your app's activities, because it provides a visual structure and interactive elements that are familiar to users. Using the app bar makes your app consistent with other Android apps, allowing users to quickly understand how to operate your app and have a great experience. The key functions of the app bar are as follows:

* A dedicated space for giving your app an identity and indicating the user's location in the app.
* Access to important actions in a predictable way, such as search.
* Support for navigation and view switching (with tabs or drop-down lists).
